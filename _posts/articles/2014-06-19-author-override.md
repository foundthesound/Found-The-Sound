Back in early March, **The Chainsmokers** played a show in Paris, France where they teased an ID that has yet to be released.

The track is a darker, dance-hall tune with a slower tempo than weâ€™re usually used to from the duo, so naturally the drop is slower and features some cool synths. However, the most prominent feature of the track would most definitely be the female vocal that sound like it could potentially be **Bebe Rexha.**
