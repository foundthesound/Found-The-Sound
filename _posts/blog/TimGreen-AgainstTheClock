Against the Clock is a series where we give an artist 10 minutes in the studio and see what they come up with. 

Tim Green has been releasing emotive dance music for a good decade now, on labels like Dirtybird and Cocoon. He’s built up a strong set-up in that time, not just in terms of his studio but the way it’s organised, with various synths, arpeggiators and even a MIDI drum running into Logic. Just look at the way he works on this video – we bet even his Mac desktop is immaculate. Green’s Eclipse EP is out now on Cocoon.
